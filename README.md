Chinese Itivuttaka


Please use files in cbeta_json folder as base for editing:
1. Add the two missing suttas
2. Add in `¶` for end of paragraph
3. Add in `&` for start of blockquote (or any other character as long as it is consistent)
4. Add in `@` for end of blockquote


Make sure all references are in the reference files at the end.

Don't forget to put in variant readings at the end.

See if it is possible to get sutta titles out of the Udanas.
